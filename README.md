# Article Preview Component

![](/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

In this challenge, I have to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I could use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to help me complete the challenge. With JavaScript, I add a share buttons functionality. 

My users can:

 - View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
 - See the social media share links when they click the share icon and share the article.
